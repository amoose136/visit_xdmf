This is my work from summer 2016. The goal is to add proper XDMF support to VisIt for use in the Chimera collaboration. It builds on the work Jake Rosa did summer 2014. In this installation are two large files managed by git lfs that can also be found on the UTK newton server in /lustre/projects/astro/chimera/lentz/. The files are chimera_00774_grid_1_01.h5, and d96-2d-sn160-00774.silo. The .h5 file is the file we seek to be able to open natively with VisIt. The .silo file was created with a script from the .h5 file and displays properly. We seek to eliminate the need for this script by using XDMF.
